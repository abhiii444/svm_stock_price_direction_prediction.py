# svm_stock_price_direction_prediction.py
This Python program implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the direction of stock prices using historical market data. It uses technical indicators derived from Open, High, Low, and Close prices to classify whether the next day’s stock price will rise or fall.
